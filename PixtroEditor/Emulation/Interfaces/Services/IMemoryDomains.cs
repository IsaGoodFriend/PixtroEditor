	/// A memory domain is a byte array that represents the memory of a distinct part of the emulated system.
	/// All cores should implement a SystemBus that represents the standard CPU bus range used for cheats for that system,
	/// In order to have a cheat system available for the core
	/// All domains should implement both peek and poke.  However,
	/// if a domain does not implement poke, it should throw NotImplementedException rather than silently fail
	/// If this service is available the client will expose many RAM related tools such as the Hex Editor, RAM Search/Watch, and Cheats
	/// In addition, this is an essential service for effective LUA scripting, and many other tools

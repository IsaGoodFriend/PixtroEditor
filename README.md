# Pixtro GBA
### An open source game engine for the GBA.
This game engine is a modified and updated version of the engine that is used in [GBAleste](https://github.com/IsaGoodFriend/Celeste-For-GBA).  I'm really proud of what I have accomplished with this project.  My goal for this project is to enable people to have an easier time developing games for the GBA.  It's no secret that the GBA is quite a handful for new developers, and I want to make this engine as easy to use as possible while still giving experienced developers the power to create their next masterpiece.


### Features
The Pixtro game engine for GBA has many features at your disposal:
- Choice of 8x8 or 16x16 sized tiles.
- Entity rendering and updating system
- Rotatable sprites
- Level compression, loading, and rendering
- Particles!
- Background scrolling
- Support for multiple extra midgrounds for extra decal/decoration
- An advanced level parsing system

### Getting Started

This engine works with devkitPro and it's features, so download and install that first.  It's also recommended that you use Programmer's Notepad.
Put the compiler and .dll(s) into the 'tools/bin' folder.  Everything should then be ready.  Unzip the engine, open the project file, and build your game!

### Documentation

Is... coming soon.  I hope?  No guarantees yet.
